## Introduction
Welcome to my personal website! This site provides an overview of who I am, what I do, and what I aspire to achieve. 

Hi, I'm Angst Gregory, a passionate Computer Science student on a journey to master the art of coding. With a foundation in business management and a love for technology, I blend analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me enjoying a game of Valorant or catching a baseball game. Dive in to learn more about my projects and interests! By the way, check out some of my projects.

## Work
### Project: Resume Talk
During my internship at CodeDays Labs, under the guidance of Abhijeet Vijayakar, the VP of Engineering at Rocket Lawyer, I collaborated with a team of three to develop an advanced interview simulator application called Resume Talk. This project involved:
- Utilizing ChatGPT 4 technology for interview question generation.
- Creating a system for users to upload their resumes in PDF format, enabling AI-driven question generation.
- Engineering an automated feedback system to assess and enhance users' interview responses.
- Spearheading front-end development by designing the UI layout and integrating it with the backend to enhance user interaction and experience.
- Implementing quality-of-life improvements for a more intuitive and responsive front-end design.

## About Me
I'm Angst Gregory, a dedicated and ambitious individual currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With an Associate's degree in Business Management already under my belt, I bring a unique blend of business acumen and technical expertise to the table.

When I'm not buried in my studies or working on coding projects, I enjoy watching baseball, playing video games, and spending quality time with friends. My favorite game to unwind with is Valorant, but I'm always open to exploring new titles and experiences.

My ultimate goal is to become a proficient software developer or engineer. I aspire to earn enough to self-sustain and invest in myself, allowing me to grow my capital and delve into hobbies and interests that I've yet to explore. I believe in continuous learning and self-improvement, and I'm eager to see where my journey in the tech world will take me.
